    "With the last class of the semester having ended a few hours ago, I find myself straddling a chair backwards to watch the two interlopers in my room. Aside from the occasional rustle of paper and the squeaking of my hand gripper as I exercise the hand I still have, there's litle to be heard."

    "Hisao and Suzu work quietly as they sit on the floor, each on opposite sides of my upturned box table. On it sits one science textbook and one notebook each, equations and notes from the former carefully being written to the latter."

    mk "I have a question."

    suz "Yes?"

    mk "Have you two noticed that exams are over, right? You can stop studying now."

    hi "That's exactly why we're studying; to go over what we felt we didn't do well with during the exams."

    mk "Uh huh. And this is happeing in my dorm room because...?"

    suz "Because someone had the silly idea that you might actually join us."

    "Hisao looks displeased with the assessment of his plan. To be fair, there was no way it'd work; I'm already firmly in holiday mode, and couldn't be paid enough to study."

    "That does remind of of something, though."

    mk "Ah right, I probably should've mentioned this earlier. There might be a problem with going to Suzu's place during the holidays."

    "Both of them look to me with interest. I guess holiday plans being threatened is enough to break them from their oh so important schoolwork."

    mk "My dad called. I ended up agreeing to go home for the break."

    suz "So you're not spending the time with us?"

    mk "Well, that's the next thing. Our house has room if you two want to come, and I'm sure dad would be fine with it."

    suz "Why do I get the feeling you've made our holiday decisions for us?"

    mk "I have no idea what you mean."

    "I pull a silly face to try and amuse her, but it doesn't work. Then again, I doubt Suzu's actually annoyed; she'd make it clear if she was."

    "Hisao, for his part, looks more contemplative than anything. I get the feeling he has a greater sense of curiosity than the norm, so a trip like this should be quite an adventure for him. Either way, his reaction doesn't escape Suzu."

    suz "I guess I'll call my parents to let them know."

    mk "You won't regret it, I promise."

    suz "You're not going to leave me alone with her, are you?"

    hi "Don't worry, I'll come. Seeing where someone like Miki grew up would be interesting."

    mk "You make me sound like some kind of weirdo."

    suz "You don't say."

    "As I'm about to protest, Suzu rubs her tired eyes wearily. It is getting pretty late, looking at the clock beside my bed."

    hi "If you want to get some rest, go ahead."

    suz "I still need to finish this..."

    hi "There's no point going on if you're tired; none of it'll stick. We can pick this up again tomorrow."

    suz "Fine."

    mk "Say 'thank you' to the teacher, Suzu."

    "To my surprise, she does, but manages to stick a barb in there."

    suz "Thanks. Now you can try teaching her."

    hi "I'm not a miracle worker."

    "Reaching for her school bag and sliding her books into it, Suzu comes to her feet and yawns as she groggily leaves the room. Both of us say our goodbyes as she does, the old door creaking shut behind her."

    "Hisao might go back to reading over his work, but my attention is elsewhere. Leaving the hand gripper on the desk, I get off my chair and sit down where Suzu previously was, picking up the notebook she's left behind."

    "Her handwriting is an odd form of scrawl, with tiny characters and no flairs at all. It's fast to write and fits a lot of text onto each page, sure, but it's also damn near impossible to read."

    mk "Guess I'll give this to her tomorrow."

    "Expecting Hisao to mention something, his silence draws me attention. Sure enough, he still sits there fiddling with some equation or another, pen tapping at his mouth thoughtfully."

    mk "I don't get it. How did a nerd like you ever get a girlfriend?"

    hi "It's not as if I was always like this. Just wasn't a lot else to do in hospital."

    mk "Really? You're pretty smart, though. I mean, Mutou praises you all the time."

    hi "I never really applied myself much before then. Messing around with friends and playing soccer was more fun."

    "He looks back down to his books, but gives up on the prospect of studying further as he sits back."

    hi "What about you, anyway? Ever had a boyfriend?"

    hi "Or girlfriend, for that matter. I won't judge."

    "I give a brief laugh at his timid indecision over which way I lean."

    mk "I'd be cool with either, but I've never really felt like getting romantic with anyone. I think friendship is underrated."

    "He nods, apparently pleased with the answer."

    hi "Hmm, it's later than I thought."

    mk "You can stay overnight if you want, I don't care. It'll be like an old-fashioned slumber party."

    hi "Sure, but... with a girl?"

    mk "It's not that weird is it?"

    hi "A teenage girl and a teenage guy, both alone in a bedroom? I think you're the one being weird."

    mk "It's a genuine offer, you know. Not my fault you're preoccupied with sex."

    hi "I am not."

    mk "You're a teenage guy, you know. You're allowed to think about that stuff; all teenagers do. Except for maybe Suzu. I'm still not sure she isn't a robot."

    mk "I guess you're lucky that you had a girlfriend, at least. Dipping your toe in while you're still young is good."

    hi "Well..."

    mk "Wait, you did get lucky with her, didn't you?"

    hi "That's none of your business."

    mk "Heh, that confirms it. If there's one thing i've learned about guys, it's that they can't resist bragging about their experience."

    hi "Leaving that aside, if you're fine with me staying overnight, I will. Not much to do in my own room, after all."

    "He attempts to play it cool, but I'm not willing to let him go that easily. Grabbing his tie and pulling him in, I give an impish grin."

    mk "You know, we could give it a try if you want. Sex is pretty fun, you know."

    mk "You're a pretty cute guy, after all. Seem pretty truthworthy, too. I wouldn't mind one bit."

    hi "That's an awfully strange way to start a relationship with someone."

    mk "'Relationship' is such a strong word. It's not like there's a law saying you have to be lovers to have sex, you know."

    "I do my best to get a read on him, but it's hard to say if he's really willing. He seems to be giving it sincere thought at least, which is heartening."

    "As moments pass, I slowly become aware that this could probably be called sexual harassment. I wouldn't want something like this to sour our friendship, and things would just be awkward if he wasn't really into it."

    "Accepting that this is Hisao's decision rather than mine, I let go of his tie and sit back."

    mk "You need to loosen up, man."

    mk "If you wanht to save yourself for someone special, that's fine. You can stay overnight to just study or talk if you want. I'm just saying that if you want to screw as well, I'd be up for it."

    hi "How can you always be so carefree? I'm kind of envious."

    mk "Well?"

    "His decision appears to be made, his staring at me ending with a great sigh."

    hi "I guess just messing about with a friend would take some anxiety out of the first time."

    mk "Right?"

    "A silence falls as Hisao's face drops."

    mk "Something wrong?"

    hi "So... do we kiss, or...?"

    "I break out into laughter. Probably the worst thing to do in this situation, but I don't care at all. How is this guy so bloody innocent?"

    mk "You're makin' me feel guilty about this!"

    hi "Yeah, yeah. Laugh it up."

    "After having a good chuckle, I manage to slowly get myself back together. His innocence is charming, but I suppose innocence itself can be fun to corrupt."

    "Knowing that Hisao taking the initiative is unlikely to happen, and would be awkward at best if he did, I decide to lead him as best I can. The box between us is easily shoved aside, leaving me to shuffle myself in front of him."

    "Reaching out and starting to pop his shirt buttons one by one, I can feel my eagerness starting to get the better of me. For Hisao's part, he takes his cue and dutifully undoes his tie."

    hi "You're pretty good at that. Undoing buttons, that is."

    mk "You learn this stuff pretty quick when you need to."

    "Coming to the bottom button of his shirt and undoing it with practiced ease, I quickly pull it off and admire the sight in front of me. I can't help but give a long, whistful breath at the sight of his bare chest."

    "He does his best not to notice, but I can tell he likes the reaction. While not exactly chiselled, it's clear he's in better shape than the average dude. Rather than being the result of some careful weights regime, his body tells of someone who, like a certain other in the club, has kept himself quite fit."

    "His heart attack was all the more unfortunate, in that light. He must've been an active and outdoorsy kind of person before that happened, and now he's stuck studying long into the night just for something to do. The scar running up his torso makes that clearer than words ever could."

    "Without thinking, I reach out and start feeling up his chest."

    mk "You're pretty nice looking, you know."

    hi "Scar aside."

    mk "It's just a line. Besides, at least you can hide it."

    mk "This might be a bit late, but are you sure it's okay to do this with your heart thing?"

    hi "Arrhythmia. I'll be okay, I just have to take it easy."

    "As I continue running my hand over him, I notice Hisao's eyes peering down into my top. He takes my smile as permission, his hand gingerly reaching forwards."

    "He seems mildly surprised at how my breast feels as he begins to gently grope my left one, feeling out its shape and seeing how it reacts when lightly kneaded."

    "My heat skips a beat as his hand chases underneath my tank top, playing with it directly before moving to my nipple. The look on his face of lust mixed with sheer curiosity turns me on more than his haphazard groping could."

    "My hand slowly moves down from his chest to his stomach, before coming over the now tight crotch of his trousers. His breath catches as I move it up and down a little, the thickening shaft inside obvious to the touch."

    "Hisao and I look to each other for a moment, the both of us knowing that there's no going back after this. Our eyes couldn't be more different, mine asking for this to continue as his show caution."

    "He manages to settle himself with with a gulp, accepting the idea of stripping in front of me. Off comes his belt, soon followed by his socks. He manages to tug off his trousers with some effort, before the reluctant strip show ends with his underwear being done away with."

    "And there Hisao is, entirely naked as he sits on the floor of my room before me. I can't help but pause a little to appreciate the lovely sight."

    "Looks like my assassment of him having a nice body was spot on, his legs also being suitably toned with a light covering of hair. Then there's his crotch, entirely exposed with its rod standing proudly erect in anticipation. I kind of want to jump his bones right now, though think better of it."

    hi "You look pleased with yourself."

    mk "Shouldn't you take pride in turning a girl on?"

    "He blushes at the praise, words stolen from his mouth as I slowly begin to lower myself down and brush back my hair."

    "I wonder if I'll ever get used to seeing a man's junk this closely. It might be more simple than a girl's, but it just looks so odd. Thankfully there's barely any smell, with only a faint musk left thanks to him having had a bath before coming."

    "Unable to help myself, I reach forward and delicately run my finger down the stiff organ from the pink head to its fleshy base, the thing twitching in response. It amuses me how they have such a life of their own, with so any involuntary motions and reactions."

    "My cheeky grin up to him is met with a grimace as he blushes heavily. My staring so closely and poking at him probably isn't helping his embarrassment, nor that I'm fully dressed while he's in the buff."

    "As much as he might enjoy this, I have to psyche myself up a little as I work up some spittle. Using my mouth to do this still doesn't feel natural, regardless of how recently he may have washed."

    "A gasp comes from Hisao as my pursed lips slide over the head, slowly moving down over his shaft. Peeking up to see his reaction shows a flustered face, his eyes trying their best to engrave what he's seeing to memory."

    "My close up view of his crotch as I do this isn't exactly great, but the hold I have over his emotions is kind of nice. It's obvious he's enjoying this, and as I begin to slowly move my head up and down, he begins to let himself go with what his body is telling him."

    "The feeling of his swollen rod pressing against my tongue spurs me to move it around a bit, as much for my own comfort as his. I must be doing something right, as restrained moans start coming from Hisao's lips."

    "I pull my mouth from him, taking the now wet shaft in my hand and using it to continue his pleasure. Given that this is the first time he's done this, I go as lightly as I can. He's already breathing heavily, his solid chest heaving as he tries to control himself."

    mk "So, what do you think?"

    hi "You know the answer to that..."

    "How unfortunate; he's getting too good at knowing when I'm fishing for praise. I just smirk."

    "Taking him into my mouth once more, I return to my motions. He seems to enjoy what I'm doing so far, so I just stick with that I've been doing."

    "Hisao must be getting close, as his breathing is beginning to get more ragged and the muscles in his groin begin to tighten. His concentration on controlling his urges is written to his face."

    mk "Miki... Ahn!"

    "My eyes open wide as thick liquid suddenly shoots into my mouth, forcefully hitting the back of my throat. Hisao's body jerks and spasms uncontrollably as he climaxes, the muscles of his shaft pumping away. All I can do is shudder as I desperately try to deal with the fluid suddenly filling my mouth."

    "The event is over, at least for Hisao, as his orgasm runs its course. With his rod slowly beginning to shrink, still twitching from its earlier vigour, I pull myself off of it and quickly bring a hand over my mouth."

    "I've never tasted this stuff before, and if I thought its texture was offputting in normal circumstances, it's ten times moreso inside my mouth. I gingerly try to swallow, but the visacous white goop sticks to the inside of my throat."

    "My gag reflex suddenly triggering, I frantically come to my feet and run over to my desk and grab for a tissue. The disgusting mucus-like mess takes some effort to get out, my body heaving as I forcefully spit and and huck."

    "I manage to get the vast majority out with some work, crumping up the tissue and throwing it at the bin before taking a few much-needed breaths of air."

    mk "Men are so gross..."

    hi "Are you okay?"

    "I wide my mouth with the back of my hand as I drearily look to him. He still sits there naked, same as before save for his face of concern and much smaller member."

    mk "You could warn me, asshole."

    hi "Does it really taste that bad?"

    mk "Imagine taking a mouthful of thick mucus. Maybe I should feed you some back one day."

    "The face he pulls says all that need be said, the boy rising to his feet with a grunt before walking over."

    "He asks for a tissue which I helpfully provide, setting about cleaning his junk as I stand next to him. I can't help but look down and watch, a little pleased that he's at least acting a bit less uptight about this stuff now."

    hi "Thanks, anyway. That felt really good."

    mk "You're talking like this is over."

    hi "But I've already..."

    mk "You're not the only one here, dude. We're not stopping at third base."

    "He looks unsure, but I guess it's understandable; it's hard to say when he'll be ready for round two. I'm still ready and rearing to go, though, so he's at least going to learn how to pleasure me before this is over."

    "I take a hold of my top and begin to lift, his eyes widening as I let it fall to the floor. My bust isn't the only thing he's going to see, with my shorts and panties following in short measure. I just stand back and put my hand on my hip, letting him admire the first naked girl he's likely seen outside of porn."

    "His hormones get the better of him, his eyes moving up and down as he takes in my figure. It's obvious that he likes what he sees."

    hi "Geez..."

    mk "I'll take that as a compliment."

    "He hesitates, but takes a step forwards towards me. I answer his hand running up my side by wrapping my arms around him to draw him into a hug, pulling us together."

    "Our hands begin to explore each other as we savour the feeling of each other's bodies, Hisao's hands pressing lustfully into my back and pressing my breasts to his chest as mine slides down his back and grips onto his hard butt."

    mk "Hisao..."

    "I can hear his lustful breathing next to my ear, his head tilting down to take a lick at the base of my neck. My mind is filled with desire, desperately wanting to ravage him."

    "Tiring of being gentle, I break from our embrace and step back towards the bed, drawing him along with me as I hold his wrist. He's starting to recharge by now, so it shouldn't take much more stimulation to get him going."

    play sound sfx_pillow

    "He steps ahead of me and slides onto the bed, with me crawling on after him. He takes the hint as I push on his shoulders a little, flopping down on his back as I shuffle about on all fours over him."

    "Throwing a leg over his head, I position myself with my head over his crotch and his head beneath mine."

    hi "So this is what it looks like..."

    mk "Hey, I had to get close to your junk before. You know how to do this?"

    hi "I'm not an idiot, you know."

    mk "I sure hope not."

    "Content with my teasing, I lower my head and lap a little at the base, trying my best not to get hairs in my mouth. I can feel Hisao's hands running up my thighs and gripping my butt as I do, taking in how it feels."

    "I let out a long sigh of pleasure as he kisses my already rather moist nub, my desire for his body finally sated. As he begins to kiss and lick at the various parts between my legs, I dutifully do my bit for him."

    "He isn't quite hitting the motions I most enjoy, but I leave him to explore my regions as he likes. As his member slowly becomes more erect from all the fooling around, it seems like he's liking this as much as I am."

    "I pick my head up, lick my lips, and slide my mouth over his shaft once more. He stops his playing with me for a moment to let out a moan of pleasure, before lapping away at me with renewed vigour."

    "The sweat on my body and his is starting to form, the scent of our excitement starting to pick up on the air. Even as I'm moving my head, I can't help a moan escaping as pleasure starts to overwhelm me."

    hi "Hey, Miki?"

    "Stopping the moment I hear his voice for fear of repeat of earlier, I pick my head up and look around to his flustered face."

    hi "Do you want to..."

    mk "Sure. Stay there a moment."

    "I pick myself off him and get off the bed, my movements a little stilted thanks to how turned on I am."

    "Reach my desk and pulling out the draw, I grab a small foil square and chuck it at him. He looks a little puzzles for a moment as it lands on his chest."

    hi "Oh, right. That was lucky."

    mk "Guessing you didn't want to run to the convenience store right now, eh?"

    "Hisao quickly sits himself up and sets about ripping the wrapper and applying the condom, sliding it over his shaft without too much trouble. As I come back to the bed, it looks like he's finally lost his reluctance about popping his cherry."

    "We end up fooling around a bit after I get back on the bed, eventually ending up with me on my back and Hisao sitting up at my waist. I suppose there's nothing wrong with him taking the lead."

    "He gives me a cautious look before taking a deep breath, eyes passing over my body. I reach down and take the bade of his rod in my hand, having a little fun in rubbing it over my wetted lower lips before pressing the head against my entrance."

    "With one slow thrust, Hisao gently pushes his hips forward and inserts himself into me as far as he can go. A long, pleasureful breath passes my lips, that wonderful feeling of fullness engulfing my mind."

    mk "Ooh..."

    hi "Miki..."

    "I look up at him, his body seeming all the lager as he sits upright, hands on the bed beside my waist. I really like this view of him."

    mk "You've done good, boy. Now stop sitting there."

    "He response by starting to move his hips, ever so slowly thrusting away as he takes in the feeling inside of me. I just let myself relax, content to sit back and let myself drift in the experience as I grip at the sheets beneath me."

    "Thankfully he needs no prompting to stop being so gentle, his timidity slowly dropping as he realises he's not going to hurt me by being a little more rough. As he keeps at it, he eventually hits a pretty nice rhythm as the sounds of our lustful breathing and bodies hitting each other begin to fill the air."

    "As much as I try top let myself just go with the flow, I can't help but smile at the expression of concentration he's making. He's really trying to do this right, and to engrave everything he's doing to memory. It's a funny contrast to how relaxed I feel as he thrusts into me."

    hi "Why are... you smiling like that?"

    mk "You just look funny, man. Relax a bit."

    "He makes an honest attempt at it, and to his credit, sort of manages to do so. As feelings of euphoria start to cloud my mind, my hand moves to start pleasuring myself, circling my nub with my finger as he goes."

    "This is so wonderful. I can't get enough of Hisao, his beautiful broad chest heaving away as he grunts and groans. His inexperience is cute, the way his mind takes in the wholly new smells, sounds, and sensations shown plainly on his face."

    "Wanting to feel that body for myself, I reach up with my arms for him."

    mk "Come here."

    "Hisao follows my directions, shifting his body down with his elbows on the bed either side of me. I wrap my arms around his back, holding his body to mine as he starts thrusting into me once more."

    "I think we're both getting close to our limits now, the sound of his breathing next to my ear turning me on further, as does the feeling of his sweat-covered back and butt as I move my hand over them."

    hi "Miki... Miki..."

    "The first flicker of extreme pleasure pulses through me as I feel myself reaching the end, clutching at Hisao's hard body as if I were trying to grab hold of that fleeting feeling."

    "My hand digs into his back as my pleasure begins to rise rapidly, my desperate attempts to catch on to each flash of ecstasy making thenm last longer and longer. Don't you dare finish on me now, Hisao. I'm so close... so close..."

    hi "Miki, I can't...!"

    "I squeeze him tightly to try and make him hold on just that little bit longer. I'm almost there, just... a little... more...!"

    mk "Ahn!"

    "I stuff my face into his shoulder as the feeling of climax rips through my entire body, every muscle clenching as hard as it can. Hisao's body, the scent of his sweat, the sound of his frantic breathing, it all fills my mind as I feel myself drowning in desire."

    "An unmistakable grunt comes from Hisao, his body jerking as the twitching and spasming around his shaft pulls him into climax as well. Once, twice, three times he gives powerful, rough thrusts into me, only serving to make my orgasm all the better."

    "But slowly, sadly, it begins to fade. I try to hold on to the threads of pleasure, but one by one they slip from my grasp, my muscles slowly relaxing as that crescendo of joy falls silent."

    "With the high of sex has to come the low, I suppose. The both of us are left a mess as our business comes to an end, our bodies both sweaty and limp, save the odd involuntary twitch."

    "I'm glad Hisao didn't roll off me after we finished; it's nice to feel his body as the warmth lingers. There's little point in asking him if it was good, as the answer to that is painfully obvious."

    "All I can do as we recover ourselves, is tiredly pet his dishevelled hair."

    "As the rumble of the tired old engine fades away, it's replaced by nothing but silence. A comfortable, nostalgic silence."

    "Looking out from the wooden bus stop, topped by a rusted sheet of iron that only barely keeps the sun out, a bright green expanse greets us."

    "The lonely cracked road cuts a straight line between the multitude of farms and rice paddies that cover the valley. A multitude of perfect rectangles, the muddy fields rimmed by embankments of thick grass, and going on as far as the eye can see."

    "All that breaks up the view are the wooden poles carrying sagging power lines, trees, and the occasional traditional-style house for the tirelessly working farmers who live here."

    "Then finally, the hills of the valley. Rising sharply on on either side of the town, they frame the entire village with their lush woods."

    "I'd say memories come back of hiking and messing around in those woods, but that's true of everywhere here. Not one thing in sight doesn't have a memory attached to it. I lived here, from my birth to just three years ago. Now, I'm finally back."

    mk "What do ya mean?"

    hi "You don't have an excuse to look distracted like we do."

    "He's not wrong. If I'd left on different terms, or even just take the chance to visit once or twice, perhaps I'd be totally ambivalent about being back here."

    "He doesn't look convinced. Suzu looks like she didn't even hear me, given that she's begun to wander around and take in the sights from outside the little shelter. It doesn't take long for her to pick up on something from down the road."

    suz "Ah, there's a truck coming."

    mk "Probably dad. Told you he wouldn't be long."

    "She skips back off the road to where we're standing, picking up her duffel bag from the chair. As the old white Kei truck slows down and comes to a stop, the unmistakable figure of my father can be seen taking off his seatbelt and swinging open the door."

    "He's a well built man, by any definition. That, in combination with his stubble and his distinct tan from labouring in the fields, would make him an intimidating figure if not for his wide smile. His cheerful expression is always the first thing people notice about him, and for good reason."

    "That said, he's not all that well kept, admittedly. His hair is cut badly from doing it himself, his stubble is shaved irregularly, and his fingernails are always blackened from dried mud underneath."

    "But that's the kind of person he always was. He loves his work, and he loves people. We might have different personalities, but I always felt a grudging respect for his outlook."

    mk "Hey, dad. It's been a while."

    "He suddenly lunges forward and wraps his arms around me, much to my admittedly halfhearted protest. I try to shout him down for doing it in front of my friends, but he only lets go after giving me a good shake."

    jun "Good to see you, girl. It's amazin' how much you've grown since I saw you."

    "I kinda want to joke with him, but I'm having trouble finding the words. It never really hit me how long three years was until now, face to face with my dad after so long. I can feel a really dumb grin on my face."

    "After taking a breath to settle myself, I clear my throat and gesture to Suzu."

    mk "Suzu, this is my dad. Dad, this is Suzu Suzuki. She's the friend I've talked to you about."

    "She bows deeply to him, to which he responds in kind. I wonder if she's trying to mask her shyness about meeting someone new through excessive manners."

    suz "Pleased to meet you, Mr. Miura."

    jun "You don't need to be so polite. Thanks for putting up with her for so long; I know how much of a handful she can be."

    suz "I try my best."

    mk "Very funny. Anyway..."

    mk "This is Hisao Nakai. He's the other friend from class I mentioned."

    "Hisao gives a smaller bow as the two greet each other. I hadn't specifically mentioned much about what Hisao was like to dad, but if he's put off by him coming, he isn't showing it."

    jun "I have to say... by the looks of you, I didn't exactly expect you two to be the kind of company Miki'd keep."

    hi "Is that a bad thing?"

    jun "Hahaha! Believe me, she could do a lot worse, boy."

    jun "Anyway, the name's Junichi. You can call me Jun or Junichi, I don't care which. 'Mr. Miura' is too damn stuffy."

    "Suzu's sly look towards me tells me one thing; Like father, like son. A loud clap from dad refocuses our attention."

    jun "Now then, who's in the back tray? We can only fit one person in the front beside me."

    mk "Me! Me! I'm in back!"

    "Hisao reluctantly raises his hand, resigned to his fate. He's a guy, he should be looking forward to this sort of adventurous thing he couldn't normally do."

    "Suzu just shrugs and chooses the front without a fight. To be honest, I didn't expect one."

    "It's nice to travel like this. The wind freely blowing past you, the occasional pothole and hump in the road bumping you up and down, and no windows to get between you and the outside world. It's far less boring than being bundled up in a little metal box."

    "Hisao, however, looks a little less sure of himself. His right hand grips the side of the tray tightly, with his back pressed hard against the cabin. Our luggage, sitting between us, bumps around loudly as we cruise down the road."

    mk "Guess it's your first time travelling on the back of a truck, huh?"

    hi "I seem to be having a lot of first times with you..."

    "He might be grumbling, but I think he's enjoying it. Just a little."

    "As we continue down the road, Hisao's head perks up as we pass something that's caught his interest."

    hi "Wait, was that a pig on that sign?"

    mk "Probably a boar. We get those around here."

    "With the familiar rumble of braking wheels on rough dirt, the truck pulls to a stop a few feet from the house. Without further ado, Hisao and I hop off as the doors around the front can be heard opening."

    "It's like I'd never left. The grey-tiled roof still remains pockmarked by the odd leaf and stray broke branch that's settled on it, and the aged wood of the walls serves as a stark contrast to Yamaku's carefully tended-to exterior."

    "Glancing through the windows, I suspect dad's been putting a bit of extra effort in to make the place presentable before we arrived. Given that I usually made most of the mess around the house before I left, I doubt it's for my sake."

    "The only major difference I can really see is the vines on one corner of the house having grown some more. Given that I've been gone since entering Yamaku, it's like stepping back in time."

    jun "So, what do ya think?"

    hi "It's nice. I haven't stayed at a traditional style house in a long time."

    suz "Likewise."

    jun "Well, I'm sure you'll get used to it. Feel free to wander around as much as you like, just be careful 'round the farm equipment."

    "He quickly walks around the back and dutifully grabs our bags, leaving me to show our guests into the house."

    "A good pull sees the door reluctantly slide away with a loud clatter, revealing the entrance foyer inside. With the interior doors having been opened to allow air to circulate through the house, most of the rooms are visible at a glance."

    "A lot of friends have said they felt like Yamaku was home after a few months, but I always felt more like a tourist in a foreign country when I was hanging around the dormitories. A school is a school, no matter where it is, but where you sleep and eat is a very different matter."

    "It could just because I'm a country bumpkin at heart. Maybe it was because of the circumstances I was in when I first entered Yamaku, or just a matter of being in the female dormitories and couped up with other girls of an evening. Either way, for the first time in years, I finally feel like I'm home."

    "I quickly take my shoes off to distract myself from my meandering thoughts, with the busily gawking Hisao and Suzu doing the same. They hurridly walk past me and into the main room after depositing their shoes, leaving me to follow behind them afterwards."

    hi "I had no idea your place was like this. You should've mentioned it before."

    "I just shrug."

    "I look to Suzu to guage her reaction, only to see her concerned face staring at her phone. Before I can ask her what's up, she starts wandering around the room haphazardly, barely managing to step around the low table and other various obstacles. All Hisao and I can do is look at each other with puzzled expressions."

    hi "Uh... Suzu?"

    "She continues on as if she's never heard him, walking around some more before slowly making her way towards the rice paper door leading outside, the sun streaming through. Without a moment's hesitation, she slides it open with her right hand, still holding her phone to her face with her left."

    "As she steps from the tatami floor onto the sunlit wooden porch, she abruptly stops and holds her phone a little higher than before."

    suz "I have a bar."

    mk "Huh?"

    "Hisao just hides his face in his hand. It takes me a moment to connect the dots about what she's actually been doing."

    "Never change, Suzu."

    "As I shake my head at her antics, I can't help but notice Hisao smiling. It's not that he does so rarely; all things considered, he manages to put on a weary smile surprisingly often. This time, though, it feels different."

    "It's going to be an interesting time here, between being home after so long, and sharing the experience with these two misfits."

    "But somehow... I think it's going to be good. The three of us together, enjoying summer in the country."

    "Knowing she's lost, Suzu and I follow him up to the door, dirt crunching underfoot as we cross the school grounds. He stands aside to let me have the honour, the old oake door reluctantly giving way with a bit of a heave."

    "Hisao and Suzu file in as I automatically tug off my shoes. Only now do I remember that a teacher won't scold me any more for failing to carefully remove my shoes and slip them into the shoe locker beside the door. Smiling, I slip them in anyway."

    "The floorboards creak as we pass over them, our trio slowly making our way through the hallway as our heads swivel about."

Glitter getting everywhere as we made a card for a boy who broke his arm. A girl crying after pricking her finger as we tried to sew plush toys."

    "Then there was the baseball team. Nearly all of them were my classmates, after all. The best friends anyone could've hoped for."

    "And then... there's me. One day, chuckling away at another terrible joke from the boy sitting to my side. Another, making a paper plane and hitting the board next to the teacher. Man that lit her up. Not to mention that frantic rush out the door every break, tearing outside to mess around be it sun or snow."

    "With a hop he starts on his way, plastering himself to the trunk with ease. He nimbly manages to hoist himself further and further upwards, usually with his feet, but sometimes resorting to reefing himself up with his hands where he can't find a foothold."

    "It doesn't take long for Hisao's to follow his plotted course, swinging a leg up over the lowest solid branch to straddle it, and scooting himself forwards to where the apples are hanging from."

    "Suzu and I just stare in surprise, both of us suitably impressed at his skill. With the sun shining through the leaves of the tree around him as he smiles down at us, quite pleased with himself at our response, I can't help but think Hisao looks a little cool. It's not often I think that about him."

    hi "So how are we doing this? Catching them by hand might be a bit hard."

    "Suzu and I look to each other. I guess I hadn't thought that far ahead."

    "Evidently coming to a conclusion she rather wishes she hadn't, Suzu sighs and she steps underneath where Hisao sits. Taking the bottom of her dress in her hands, she holds it out a little, forming a net to catch them with. If it works, it ain't stupid."

    "Apparently happy with the idea, Hisao calls out before dropping the first apple. Successfully caught without any problems, he starts twisting off one after another, sending them falling to Suzu."

    "With none of us having discussed exactly how many we'd take, he ends up stopping once Suzu's skirt is reasonably full. Overcome with temptation, I pluck one out and take a bite to see how they are."

    "The answer turns out to be 'pretty damn good'. I stand there and munch away as Hisao lets his body roll off the branch, hanging by a hand for a moment to gauge the fall before dropping to the ground on his feet."

    "I wander towards the figure out of curiosity. If it's a burglar, I could probably take 'em anyway."

    "The stars, huh? I look up at them as he does, trying to get what about them interests him. All I see are the same stars I've always seen. Pinpricks of light in the night sky. They're pretty, I suppose, but I don't think that's what draws Hisao."

    "I get the feeling this is one of the main differences between us, besides the different ways we grew up. I only see what's in front of my eyes. The world as it is. Hisao's eyes seem to see so much more than mine do, and as we sit here looking up at the same night sky, even now I can see that childlike wonder on his face."

    hi "It's so quiet out here."

    mk "Yeah, I was just thinking that. Guessing the city would be different?"

    hi "Out in the suburbs it's fairly quiet. The nightlife around some places though is a culture all its own."

    mk "Is it all seedy and stuff like in the movies?"

    hi "If you go looking for those kinds of places, yeah, they're around. When you get that many people in one place, you start seeing some weird stuff beneath the surface."

    hi "Don't let your imagination get too wild; I walked pretty damn quickly if I ever found myself in those areas. Mainly just stayed downtown, with all the shoppers and gaming places. Lights and advertisements everywhere, crowds buzzing, music on the air from nightclubs and karaoke parlours, it's just so different to the dead of the night around here."

    mk "That sounds so cool. We should totally travel into the city over a weekend some time. Bet Yukio and Haru would have a blast."

    mk "So, you got a rubber?"

    hi "That's completely different. Can't you just watch porn if you want to see a guy do it himself?"

    mk "You know porn's completely different from reality. I wanna see how a dude really does it."

    mk "Fine, how about I do myself as well? Does that sound good?"

    "He moves to protest, but the words don't come out. It's a little amusing to see him to visibly ponder the question now that the scales have been tipped."

    "Eventually, he takes a long, shakey breath. It looks more like an admission of defeat than a teenager getting the chance to fool around with a girl."

    "Hisao pulls himself back off the side of the porch, both of us turning to face each other as we sit. I guess I got the advantage, with my back pressed against the wall for a backrest."

    "It's only now that I realise what I've gotten myself into. Getting another person off is one thing; you're focused on making them feel good, after all. This, however, is the sort of thing I've only ever thought of as being done in private. Of course, it'd be just the same for him."

    "For a brief moment, I try to think of this as simply watching 3D porn. It doesn't work at all."

    "With great hesitation, Hisao begins to work off his pants, followed by his underwear. With the two sitting by his side, his stick is sitting there plain to see, the tuft of hair behind it not quite hidden. His eyes move up and down, trying to look at me, but finding himself too embarrassed."

    "It'd be a lie to say that doesn't turn me on a bit. Being able to watch him do this for my benefit."

    hi "Could you not stare?"

    mk "That's kinda the point, dude."

    "He tilts his head in resigned acceptance as his hand haltingly makes its way onto his shaft."

    "With the other hand on the ground for support, he begins to move it up and down. The first thing I notice is that he doesn't bring it over the head, but only along the lower part. It also looks like a pretty form grip he has on the thing, whereas I'd always thought it'd be way looser."

    "It's an odd atmosphere as he strokes himself, my elbow resting on my knee as I watch intently. His gaze begins to wander over my body as he goes, mentally trying to undress me as he gets more and more aroused."

    "As time goes on, the first bits of liquid start to seep out onto the head, flowing down and mixing with the motions of his hand. A slight pain from the side of my thumb makes me realise I've begun absentmindedly rubbing at it with the fingernail of my other finger."

    "Man... this really is turning me on. That mixture of arousal and shyness, the way he tries to imagine me as he pleasures himself."

    "Having had enough of enjoying this purely as an observer, I work off my shorts and underwear, spreading my legs a little to allow him a small reward."

    "I slide my hand down past my own lower hair and onto my own organs, already moistened from being able to watch him. If nothing else, at least it's been a damn enjoyable show to watch."

    "After bringing my fingers inside myself to wet them further, and enjoying the sensation enough to make a few motions before pulling them back out, I begin to work at my nub. Circling, petting, stroking this way and that with my fingertips."

    "Watching the precum continue to form on Hisao's shaft as he plays with himself, a pleasant sigh escapes my lips. Maybe it's because I was able to get off on watching him beforehand, but this isn't as weird as I thought it'd be."

    hi "Enjoying yourself?"

    mk "Sure as hell. You're really trying not to shoot too early, aren't you?"

    hi "This still feels weird to do in front of someone..."

    mk "Just go with it. Besides, you're getting to see me too."

    "I feel my muscles shiver as a small spike of pleasure runs through me. My toes curl as I keep going, the cold wood on my butt and cool breze on the outdoor air doing little to temper my excitement."

    "As exciting as this might be, though, it isn't quite what I want. My fingers move faster and faster over the areas I most like being touched, and under normal circumstances that would be enough, but it's the thing before me that I want right now."

    "Hisao pauses as I reluctantly stop my playing and pull myself to my feet."

    hi "Hey, what are you...?"

    mk "Sssh."

    "I bring a finger to my lips, before covering my bared area with my hand and scuttling inside, closing the door behind me lest somebody see the half-naked boy. This would be a terrible time for someone else to be walking about the house."

    "Finding the room empty, much to my relief, I skitter over to my own wallet sitting on an end table near the door. Opening it with some difficulty, I only barely manage to make out what's inside of it, retrieving what I want before coming back."

    "Opening and quietly shutting the door behind me once more, I give the bewildered Hisao only a passing glance as I take a seat right before him. He looks on wordlessly, his shaft having regrettably shortened as he awkwardly cups it from modesty."

    hi "You had one? Seriously?"

    "As much as I'd like to make some quipt at him, my mouth is full with the foil square gripped in my teeth. Managing to get a good tear, the top of the package obediently flicks off, letting me grab the translucent white condom inside before spitting it out."

    "My heart racing as my sense of temptation starts to get the better of me, I give him a gentle push. He gives no resistance as I move to roll the condom on his quickly expanding rod before he can protest any further, managing to do so with a couple of abortive attempts."

    "Straddling his body, I lose any sense of hesitation and I move to rip off his top."

    hi "Miki, please...!"

    "He might be offering to do it himself, or wanting to scuttle the whole thing for fear of somebody hearing us, but I'm past caring. Yanking at his clothing, it finally comes off after some force is applied to the problem. His beautiful bare chest is my reward, the line from his surgery doing little to slow my rushing hormones."

    "Pressing my hands against his lower stomach, I raise my knees for leverage and start to lower myself onto his rod, stopping a couple of times as I feel it bumping either side of the critical hole."

    "A long, deep sigh of euphoria rings out from the both of us as I feel it finally slide in, his thick shaft pressing against the moist, warm walls inside of me. Even through the condom the parts of his penis can be felt out, from the top of its head to its very base."

    "I really do like this position. Looking down at him shows a flustered face, sweaty and dazed as he looks up at me and my body. I have total control over him now, and over my own pleasure."

    "Without further ado, I begin to move my hips up and down, the feeling of penetration made all the better thanks to my knees being the air. My breasts move about as I do, the tank top providing little support for them."

    "We both do out best to keep the noise down, given our situation. I manage pretty well, I think, keeping my wits about me despite the usual huffs and puffs of being the one doing the work."

    "Hisao, as seems to usually be the case, is somewhat less controlled. It gives me a chance to get back at him."

    mk "You look like you're enjoying this."

    hi "I don't think... I can't..."

    mk "Settle down, boy. You just need... to go with it."

    "The words do little to calm him as my hips continue thrusting up and down, his crotch no doubt a mess from our combined fluids. I can feel my muscles starting to tighten slightly as I try to control my feelings as best I can, but as this goes on, that becomes increasingly difficult."

    "He really is quite a looker with his clothes off. That heaving chest of his, a thin sheen of sweat now covering it, looks nicer than ever."

    mk "Nnnnn... Hisao..."

    hi "Please, I can't..."

    "From the tone of his voice, this isn't going to last much longer. I keep moving regardless, the euphoria runnng through every inch of my body telling me to drive onward."

    "The look on his face as he clenches his teeth, holding on for dear life to try and keep this going jusy a few moments longer makes me even more excited. Harder and harder he tries, teetering on the edge as he desperately attempts to hold on."

    "More... I want more of him. Hold on boy, I just want that little bit more..."

    hi "Ahn...!"

    "His mouth opens wideas the rush of climax surges through him like a lightening bolt, his pelvis hitting so hard against my own that it almost hurts."

    "Once, twice, three times his hips jerk upward as intense muscles spasms grip him, eyes open wide as he orgasms. His entire body shakes and shivers as it grasps every little bit of the intense pleasure running through him."

    "And then... it's over. His hips sink back down to the wooden boards for the last time, rod still twitching away as his mouth hangs open and gasps for air. His eyes look dreamy and unfocused, the rush of hormones still leaving their mark."

    "Knowing that I've had my fun for tonight, I slip myself off his slowly dwindling rod The experience has take its toll on me just as much as it has on him, leaving me flat on my back and gasping for air too."

    "The two of us must look like dying fish right now, both lying on the porch with heaving bodies, our open mouths gulping for air."

    hi "You're crazy."

    mk "I was just... turned on..."

    hi "I can't believe... you hid that you had one..."

    jun "Well, there's not much point dwelling on it. Seems you've lived quite a life since you left."

    jun "One of the things I've learned over the years, is that keeping a tight leash on someone like you would never work out. If you need me, I'm here, but I know you want to work through these things yourself."

    "That's probably the best reaction I could've hoped for. While I wouldn't say our relationship's ever been bad, I've never been the best behaved kid. He surely knows, at least in vague terms, how much of an asshole I was in Yamaku, but resisted the urge to force me back home, or threaten to do so. It might've take the intervention of Suzu, but I finally managed to get myself mostly sorted out. I doubt that would've happened if he'd gone through with it."

That said, the fact he accepts that I'm moving along my own path relieves me. I'd harboured that seed of doubt in the back of my head for so long, and now I can finally let it go."

    suz "At least you didn't bring along the others from the track club."

    mk "Hey, they're not that bad."

    suz "And yet, the only one you brought along was Hisao."

    mk "And?"

    suz "You can be so stupid sometimes."

    suz "I'll say it straight: you're interested in him, aren't you?"

    "The question leaves me momentarily speechless, my body sinking into the bath a bit as I try to pin down my feelings."

    "If she puts things that way, it does look pretty suspicious. Hisao's a cool guy to hang out with, and his personality has become more interesting since I first met him. It's a little nice to look back and see that."

    "But going out with him? I've never felt romantically attracted to anyone in the past, so I'm not sure how I'm supposed to work out if I'm falling for the guy or not. Relationships seem so constricting that I'm not sure I want to be in one in the first place. This untethered life has its advantages."

    "I wonder if that's how he sees things, though. Now that I think about it, I never took his feelings into account."

    mk "That sure is a gnarly question..."

    "Suzu looks genuinely surprised that I'm mulling it over. She probably got some idea that I'd fallen for him in her head, and been running with it for a while now. It's only now that I realise she may have an ulterior motive in asking."

    mk "Wait, are you?"

    suz "He's a friend. Nothing more."

    "She gets points for making herself clear, at least. It's too bad; I would have thought him to be just her type."

    mk "I just brought him here because I thought he might enjoy it. When he said he didn't have any friends back home to spend the time with, I guess I could..."

    mk "Damn it, what's the word...?"

    suz "Empathise with him?"

    mk "Yeah, that's it! I could understand how that'd feel, so I let him hang with us."

    suz "So that's why most of this trip we've been on a tour of your childhood."

    "So now we finally get to the heart of the topic. She thinks I've been showing Hisao my past out of affection."

    "I guess I have been somewhat selfish in how I've been dragging them around with me whereever I wanted to go."

    suz "Don't worry about me or Hisao. If you have past debts to settle, go ahead and deal with them."

    mk "You make it sound like I have baggage."

    suz "Not a person alive who doesn't."

    "I guess that makes one person in the world who knows the carefree life I live in Yamaku isn't completely truthful. Even I thought I had my shit together, but it turns out life isn't always so simple."

    mk "Thanks. Suzu. I probably don't say this enough, but I'm glad to have you around."

    "I wait for a reply, but the only sound to be heard is water trickling in."

    "I give Suzu another bump on the cheek with my stump, but this time, no reaction is forthcoming."

    "Well, I guess staying in for a few more minutes wouldn't hurt."

    "A gentle breeze flows through my hair as I stand where I'd spent so much of my childhood."

    "It's a sorry excuse for a baseball pitch, I suppose. Not much more than a disused field near the school, covered in dirt and tan gravel. The only sign of what it was ever used for are the barely visible white lines on the ground, and a couple of benches to the side."

    "The batting stance is still second nature after all these years, a reasonably straight branch serving as a makeshift bat as I prepare for the pitch. The beat-up pitching machine before me stands silent, ready to spit a ball at me at any second."

    "A heavy clunk sends the entire machine shuddering on its legs, the ball sent flying towards me at a relatively easy speed."

    "The familiar feeling of impact flows through my arm, my entire body twisting as I give a good, solid hit."

    "The ball flies up, arcing into the sky..."

    "...Before giving up, pathetically dropping back down near second base. It gives a soft thud as it hits the ground, all energy lost as it barely even rolls before coming to a halt."

    "Worthless. Utterly shit. I knew I shouldn't have tried."

    "Infuriated, I slam the stick against the ground, breaking it in half without even trying. The spike of adrenaline in my system spurrs me into flinging the half still in my hand into the air in a rage, sending it flying far further than the ball ever got."

    "Far from satisfied, I walk over to the pitching machine and give it a strong kick. the old thing falls to the ground with a loud clatter, but I'm sure it still works just fine. It's managed to survive so damn long that I probably couldn't kill it no matter how much I abused the thing."

    "The destruction at least lets me vent off a bit of steam, leaving me standing around frustrated and empty-handed. For lack of anything else to do, I give up and let myself fall back onto the ground with a thud. It hurts a bit to land on the gravel, but I don't care."

    "Baseball's supposed to be played with both hands still attached to their wrists, after all. It's pathetic - I can't even get a clean hit past the bases, let alone aim in any meaningful way. It's obvious time wouldn't change that, but something in my head kept whispering to me. Urging me to try just once, for old time's sake."

    "While some things might be the same, there are a few oddities that have popped up since I left. This place is one of them."

    "It's the kind of eatery that wants to be a restaurant, but can't help feeling more like a cafe. While the owner seems to be making a genuine effort at making their dream come true in owning their own little restaurant, their budget - and likely their customer base - is lacking."

    "But the food is what counts, and as the owner places a bowl of tempura soba before each of us, the smell is enough to know this is going to be good."

    "I split my chopsticks and grab at the tempura, taking a good chunk out of it as the noodles steam away. Hisao, on the other hand, simply blows on his bowl with the tempura still in it."

    "The two of us are briefly distracted by an impromptue visitor, with a dishevelled stray cat strolling past us as if it owned the place. It eventually hops up onto the sill of an open window, flicking its tail for a few moments before hopping down."

    "Hisao just smiles, which at least lightens my own mood a little."

    mk "I guess I just couldn't admit that it was over."

    hi "I had no idea you were so into baseball. Were you good?"

    mk "Boy, I was the cleanup hitter. Slammed that thing harder than any of 'em could."

    hi "You must've been pretty talented."

    mk "'Talent' is how lazy people justify being bad at something."

    mk "I worked my god damn ass off to get that good. I lived and breathed baseball. Followed the leagues, had my favourite players, watched it on the little television even when the reception was shit. I put blood, sweat, and tears into it, all to run for the base just a second or so quicker, and hit the ball just a that few more yards."

    mk "It was my thing, you know? I had purpose. I could always aim to be that little bit better every day. I never felt lost in life, because I could see the path ahead so clearly. I was going to devote myself to becoming the best there was, whether I was a boy or a girl."

    "As soon as we walk in the door, bikes left propped against the wall, I can hear the voices of Suzu and dad from the living room. Wondering what they'd have to talk about, Hisao and I head towards the source."

    mk "Do you have to show them that...?"

    jun "I don't get to do this often, you know."

    "Resigned to my fate, I follow Hisao to the table. Everyone crowds around to get the best view as dad sits to the side."

    "Having progressed past the baby photos and elementary school, it sits at the years I was in junior high. A school photo takes up most of the page, with a few elementary students sitting on chairs as about fourteen junior highschoolers - me included - stand behind them in our summer uniforms."

    suz "I like the outfit."

    "She points to the back row, the girls clad in our black-trimmed white sailor tops and long black skirts, and the boys in their smart white shirts. I don't mind the look, though they tended to get dirty pretty fast."

    suz "Was this seriously the whole school?"

    jun "Sure was. One class for elementary students, another for junior high. The teachers were good folks, despite whatever Miki's said."

    hi "That's you, isn't it?"

    "He points to a girl in the back row, grinning away happily."

    mk "How'd you know?"

    "Dad chuckles as he turns the page, but the corner of his mouth tugs downwards upon catching sight of the next photo."

    "Ten boys and a girl, all of us dressed in identical pinstrip baseball outfits. A lot less formal than the classroom photo, some have arms around those next to them, while others pull faces. One of my better friends at the time grabs me in close around my neck as I hold my trusty bat over my shoulder. Our ponytailed coach simply stands by us, smiling with pride at the team he worked so hard to raise."

    "Every one of us was a friend to each other. We had fights of course, as friends sometimes do. As we got older, those fights sometimes ended up with real injuries, too. Given a focus for our youthful energy, we all poured ourselves into the sport, trying to be the best junior team there was."

    "The last few months of my life here saw that wonderful life crumble before my eyes."

    "I notice Hisao looking sidelong at me. Without knowing quite how to react, I just look away."

    suz "So this is the baseball club you were in."

    suz "Wait, you were the only girl?"

    mk "Yeah. Why?"

    suz "A lot of things about you suddenly made a lot of sense..."

    "Hisao's constant attempts to be tactful make it all too tempting to tease him."

    suz "What happened to them? Are they still around?"

    jun "They left for the city. Happens a lot, these days."

    hi "I heard about that. Lots of rural places having problems with the younger generations moving out, without people replacing them."

    jun "That's exactly it. The way I see it, there's not much of a future in places like this."

    suz "That must be frustrating."

    jun "Frustrating? Nah. Some of the older folks 'round here have Opinions when it comes to today's kids, but I don't hold it against 'em."

    jun "You two would know better than most how inviting city life must be. 'Convenient' was the word they used when they described it after leaving."

    suz "But still, this is your home."

    jun "It might be a home, but it's also a business. Gotta make money to live, after all."

    jun "When you're up against those gigantic agriculture corporations, little family farms like this one don't stand much of a chance. It's the same story for all the farms here, whether the old coots admit it or not."

    jun "While it used to be a vibrant, lively place, I can't help but feel the town's not much more than a museum piece these days. Don't know if it'll take years or decades, but eventually this way of life just isn't going to exist any more."

    suz "I'm sorry for bringing it up."

    jun "Don't be. Change happens, I know that. Ain't a good thing or a bad one. It's just the way things go."

    jun "But even so... I guess it does feel a little bit sad."

    hi "Because it proves those times existed. Just because she broke up with me, it doesn't mean the times we had before that went away."

    hi "It's not just her, either. Ever since I saw the nostalgia on your face, I guess I felt sort of the same thing as I thought back to my childhood."

    hi "I know it's not the same as baseball was to you, but I never appreciated how much soccer practice meant to me until I lost it. Just getting together with friends every week to kick a ball around. It sounds so trivial, doesn't it?"

    "He leans back and closes his eyes, his mind obviously in another place."

    hi "Messing around at arcades with friends. Gazing at cute girls. Sneaking peeks at dirty magazines in convenience stores. Riding bikes around the city. Covertly exchanging notes with friends during class. Hoping for a good mark as each new test rolled around."

    hi "And then sitting alone in a hospital bed, smelling bleach and staring at four sterile white walls."

    mk "What happened to them? Your friends, that is."

    hi "They visited damn near every day at first, All of us chatting away as they kept me up to date on what was happening at school and at soccer."

    hi "Then it became once every few days. Then once a week. As time went on, we stopped talking so much. None of us outright said it, but it was pretty obvious I was moving further and further from ym circle of friends. They were living lives full of new experiences every day, while I just saw the occasional new patient wheeled into the room every so often."

    hi "Then finally, one day... they stopped coming at all."

    hi "I guess they got bored of me."

    mk "How can you say that so easily?"

    hi "Hmm... probably because I knew it was coming. It was the same for Iwanako, as well. A long, slow fade to nothing, rather than any kind of dramatic breakup."

    hi "I suppose that's why I couldn't throw out that letter. It'd be easy to say my life got reset when I started at Yamaku, but that'd be a lie."

    hi "I lived. It was a good life, too. Even if I can't return to those times any more, I think I want to remember them."

    mk "And that's what you wanted to say to me before."

    hi "Pretty much. I just wanted to let you know that you're not alone. I kinda get what you're going through."

    "Only now do I realise what made me notice him in the first place after he transferred in. That feeling of connection, of sharing something, that was always in the background."

    "Sure enough, in the distance I can see sunlight breaking through the line of trees. Just a little further, and we should reach the spot."

    "Emerging from the forest into the clearing, Hisao and I stop side by side to take in the sight. A couple of fallen logs stripped of their branches and laid either side of a stone campfire pit lay in the center, with an old tire hung from a branch by a fraying rope to the side."

    "Near my feet sits a faded 'keep out' sign, the pole attached to it having come out of the ground during some storm or another. We probably didn't follow building standards all that well when we hammered it into the ground."

Managing to grasp the small bag they're in with the tips of my fingers, I pull them out as I take a seat."

    "Hisao unclips the bag slung around his shoulder, lifting the flap and grabbing a bottle filled with water. I'm glad to have a chance to rest my legs, but it's Hisao I'm more worried about. Now that he's seated, that terrible wheeze he sometimes gets has returned."

    "I almost offer if he'd prefer to turn back after we're done here, but think better of it. He'd just say we should keep going, regardless of whether he was having chest problems or not."

    "It worries me, but it also makes me admire him a little. It's easy to be all gung-ho when you're a fit peson in the prime of your life, but Hisao pushes himself hard all the time despite his condition, both around here and on the track at Yamaku."

    "Maybe that's why he's such a balanced person. After all, he has a good, sensible head on his shoulders, is reasonably fit given everything that's happened to him, and is smart enough to be Mutou's pet in class. He might be a bit awkward socially, but at least he tries to be outgoing."

    "Just an all-round good kid, really. Too bad that doesn't mean shit when life decides to screw you over."

    hi "Any good?"

    mk "Hmm?"

    hi "The rice balls."

    mk "Oh, right. Guess they're okay."

    hi "Did you make them, or what?"

    mk "Yeah. It's kinda hard to mess up rice balls, though."

    hi "True."

    "Well, there is one thing about him I don't like; that tendency of his to so visibly think about what he wants to say. The topic of cooking's put something into his head, but he won't come out with it."

    mk "What's up?"

    hi "I was trying to put this tactfully, but I guess that's unnecessary when it comes to you."

    "I give a disarming smile at his attitude. He takes it as permission to go on."

    hi "Is your mother, uh..."

    "Oh, it's just that. I probably should have said something about it to him before it became the elephant in the room."

    "COme to think of it, I wonder how long that's been on his mind, and Suzu's for that matter. Don't tell me he's been trying to ask me about that for the entire time he's been here..."

    mk "Man, you don't need to pussyfoot around that stuff."

    mk "It's not much of a story, to be honest. My mother ditched me and dad when I was really young. About three years old, I think."

    hi "She just left?"

    mk "Yep, up and left. Got her stuff, walked out the door, and that was the last either of us ever saw or heard of her again."

    hi "Geez. That's rough."

    "I just shrug. It is what it is. Not like I was old enough to understand what was going on, or even to really remember the event in the first place."

    "Leaning forwards with my arm outstretched to offer some rice balls to Hisao, he takes a couple and starts grazing on them."

    hi "Do you ever wonder where she is now? Whether you might be able to contact her somehow?"

    mk "She could be dead in a ditch for all I care. Why would I give a shit about someone who abandoned their own baby and left her husband heartbroken?"

    "I don't have any trace of anger in my voice, but the idea obviously puts Hisao off. I don't blame him; I've long since come to accept that my situation is different to the vast majority of people out there. That's not their fault, nor mine."

    hi "You might have a half-sister or half-brother, though."

    "That's not a terrible argument, but I already know my answer."

    mk "I guess I've never put that much weight on blood ties."

    mk "Having a sister would've been kinda nice, though. A younger one, so I could dote on her and be the cool older sis."

    hi "Yeah, I could see that."

    mk "What about you? Only child, right?"

    hi "Yeah, no sisters or brothers for me."

    hi "I dunno, I think I'm pretty okay with it. I'm good with kids, but I don't know about growing up beside one."

    mk "So you're the fatherly type, huh?"

    hi "I could see myself with kids, yeah. Having a family would be good."

    hi "What's with that face?"

    mk "Were you born forty years old?"

    hi "Some of us can look further into the future than the next meal, you know."

    "I just laugh. He's not wrong, really."

    "Finishing his last rice ball and putting away his bottle, Hisao clips up his bag and takes to his feet, collecting his trekking pole before walking over and offering me a hand up."

    hi "Good to go?"

    mk "You know it."

    "The trek takes its toll on our legs as we push ourselves along, the incline up the hill now quite severe. Not only that, but the overgrown roots sticking out of the ground and uneven rocks leading upwards force us to be careful that we don't break or twist an ankle."

    "It's painful, but not all pain is bad. From the way Hisao's holding onto his waist, it looks like he's in more pain than I, having developed a stitch. Better that than a heart problem, I suppose."

    hi "How... far is it... to go?"

    mk "Stop whining, you big baby."

    hi "That's easy... for you to say."

    "Hisao pushes himself a little harder after I've scolded him, despite what he says. At least his awkwardness about being beat out physically by a girl has finally disappeared."

    "More and more rays of sunshine manage to peek through the leaves overhead, casting spots of light on the lush green bushes around us."

    "My heart is beginning to beat faster and faster, but it isn't from exhaustion. We're so nearly there. Just a little further now."

    "The look of the area's changed a fair bit from when I was last in this spot, but that's only natural given the surroundings dying off and regrowing. Something about it feels familiar, though. I can't quite put my finger on it, but it's there."

    "The feeling of tiredness in my muscles slowly begins to fade from my mind, as do the sounds of the birds and other wildlife. Dropping my makeshift pole, it takes some effort not to run the last of the distance, anticipation filling my body."

    "Sunlight assaults my eyes as I emerge through the treeline, forcing me to squint heavily. As my eyes adjust, the sight before me is just as tremendous as I'd hoped."

    "I hear Hisao come up behind me, gasping wordlessly at the view."

    "From where we stand, the entire town can be seen below. The breeze brushes past us as we stand and stare, taking in the vast fields and the narrow roads between them. Old wooden farmhouses, some newely restored, others run-down from old age. The river cutting through the valley, acting as a vital artery to the entire town. Telephone poles with wires hanging loosely, running alongside the streets."

    "I can't help but give a whistful smile as I turn back to Hisao."

    mk "Welcome to my home, Hisao."

    mk "My entire life is down there, you know. Where I was born, where I played and where I went to school. Where I found a dream, and had it dashed. Where I made friends, and lost friends. It might not be much, but it's mine."

    "I take a long breath to steady myself. It's not often I get emotional, but after so long, I just can't help it."

    mk "This is why I brought you here, Hisao. I did get kinda wrapped up in my own nostalgia for the place, but in the end, we managed to get here."

    "I bring my arms out wide before letting them fall back to my sides."

    "Hisao just looks wordlessly at my smiling face, before letting himself fall to the ground with a thud. Completely exhausted, he just sits with his hands on the ground behind him, looking into my eyes as he pants and sweats heavily."

    "Now that I think of it, I must look a total mess right now, too. Sweat's all over me, and I can feel a couple of hairs stuck to my face. That fact quickly becomes unimportant as I look into Hisao's eyes, suddenly noticing something different inside of them."

    hi "I can't take this any more! You win already!"

    mk "Huh? What're you goin' on about?"

    "He pauses to take some much-needed air, before looking to me with a face full of both exhaustion and... a warmth that I've never seen him have before."

    hi "I love you, Miki."

    "My heart stops. No, it would be more correct to say the whole world around me stops."

    "With me take completely by surprise, it's Hisao who fills the silence."

    hi "I've completely fallen for you. I don't know if this can go anywhere, but I can't take this any longer."

    hi "You've shown me so much, that I feel like a child seeing the world for the first time all over again. I want to keep on seeing new things, too."

    hi "And I want to see them with you, together."

    "Questions slowly begin to fill my mind. How long has he liked me? What should I say? What do I do? Should I have noticed his feelings before now? We had a good thing going with our friendship, but could we ever go back to it now?"

    "But somehow... none of those questions really seem to matter. All that I can think about, is the boy sitting before me, eyes full of weariness, hope, and love. Nobody's ever looked at me with such a face before."

    "So that's Hisao's judgement, after seeing all this. I showed him everything, and what he felt from that, was love."

    "It's kinda funny. So much so that I start laughing. I don't really know why it's funny at all, but it just so seems inexplicably hilarious that I can't stop. Hisao just looks up at me luke a buffoon, unable to interpret my response at all."

    "I take a deep breath to collect myself, smiling down at him."

    mk "You sure make a terrible Romeo."

    "He just hangs his head at the quip. He might not exactly be the most poetic type, nor the most manly in sweeping me off my feet... but that's fine. For good or bad, he's Hisao."

    "I offer him a hand, which he takes as he levers himself back up."

    "With the two of us side by side on the peak of the hill overlooking the town, I sling my arm around his neck."

    "Cloaked in a deep blue glow, Hisao stands wide eyed as he stares up at the tank before him. I'd tease him for being so amazed, but I'm doing just the same."

    "A giant manta ray, impossibly huge, breezes past the window with its underside pointed at us. It's crazy how easily it cuts through the water with such small movements. Its mouth and gills look bizarre, so totally unlike anything that walks on land."

    mk "Animals are cool."

    hi "Sure are."

    "As it glides around to the back of the tank, we start walking to the next display."

    "A gaggle of teenage girls on the other side of the passage shriek in excitement, apparently overcome by the cuteness of a couple of turtles which swam up close to the window. You'd be forgiven for thinking they were fawning over a baby or something."

    "We join a father and his young son at a shark tank, several of them lazily swimming about their enclosure. They're not exactly at their most menacing when they're cooped up like this, looking more bored than ravenous."

    "Hisao doesn't seem to mind, though, still watching them float about with interest. Looks like I struck it out of the park on this one."

    mk "Having fun there?"

    hi "I had no idea this city had an aquarium. You ever come here before?"

    mk "Me? Nah. Probably should've."

    "He goes back to looking at them swimming away after I give a shrug. It's now that I notice the young boy staring not at the sharks, but at the one-handed girl nearby. Maybe I should take pride in being more interesting than a few sharks."

    "I poorly mime clutching at my stump and yelling with pain, drawing a smile from the kid. The spaces where he's lost a couple of baby teeth make it look all the cuter."

    "I quickly step back and stiffen up as Hisao turns back around to see what the movement was, pretending nothing happened. Doubting me, Hisao looks over to the boy. He does just the same, though even less convincingly than my own act."

    "Thoroughly beaten, Hisao moves on with me quickly falling in beside him. I think I see a smile there, no matter how much he might try to play it off."

    hi "You don't seem all that interested in the sea life."

    mk "Just too used to seeing them, especially wild ones."

    hi "I guess when you grow up with something, it becomes the norm."

    mk "Sure does. The aquarium's pretty cool though; it's first time I've seen some of these critters."

    mk "You have a nice smile, you know that?"

    hi "What brought this on?"

    mk "I was just thinking how different you are to when you first started in Yamaku. If you had a colour back then, it would've definitely been grey."

    hi "And now?"

    mk "Hmm... you look kinda blue right now."

    "It takes a second for him to get it, but his face drops once he does."

    hi "Right, the light from the tanks. Very funny."

    hi "I don't think anybody would argue that your colour's red, as if it were ever a question."

    hi "But yeah, I feel different to when I started at Yamaku as well. I can't see the entire path in front of me yet, but it feels like the fog is beginning to lift."

    hi "A lot of that is thanks to you, you know. The world didn't change after I had my heart attack, I just got to see a whole different part of it."

    hi "Maybe that's why I kinda get Mutou. When he goes on about how interesting this part of science is or that, he's really talking about a new way of seeing the world. Of understanding what's around us."

    mk "Understanding Mutou, now that's a scary thought."

    "I am glad, though. It feels less like I'm dragging Hisao along life with me, and more like he's back on his legs and starting to walk on his own. It reminds me of how Suzu and I ended up."

    "That I can be there for another person like that makes me pretty happy."

    "Eventually we reach the exit of the aquarium proper, entering the small gift shop. The two of us part to look at this knicknack or that, from small stuffed animals to phone straps and stickers."

    "I feel like I should buy something for Hisao given that he paid for both our tickets, but even if he hadn't offered to get them, I couldn't have afforded one. You can practically see the tumbleweeds blowing across the empty expanse of my wallet."

    "As I ponder my sadly lacking funds, I come across to the clothing section. It leaves me wondering who would want a hoodie with the name of an aquarium proudly displayed on it."

    "One thing does catch my interest, though. A baseball cap with a nice colour scheme and thankfully small logo. I pick it up to check the price, but end up sighing before putting it back on the shelf. Sometimes I can afford the odd luxury, but this isn't going to be one of those weeks."

    hi "What's up?"

    mk "Nothin'. Found something, did you?"

    "I point to the small stuffed turtle in his hand."

    hi "Just something small to remember the place. You going to grab anything?"

    hi "Sure. See you there."

    hi "What are you saying? The date's not over yet."

    "I feel his hands on my waist, and as I turn to see him, I find out lips pressed together. I just close my eyes, letting myself be take in my the sensation."

    "His warm body held to mine, the tickling of his breath against my face, the brushing of his hair against my forehead.... Even if it's not exactly a passionate embrace, I can still feel my heart skip a beat."

    "It's terrible how I fold so quickly like that when take off guard. It takes me a moment to notice Hisao's hand retrieving something from the bag, leaving me to look up stupified as he plops the object onto my head."

    mk "How did you..."

    hi "I noticed you staring at it in the shop. I think it looks good on you."

    "A good jog around the track is probably one of the more productive ways to deal with stress. God knows I'd be in a world of hurt if I told that woman what I really thought of her."

    "Given the amount of sweat building up already, the thought passes my mind that I should actually count the number of laps I do one of these days, or time myself doing some sprints. Compared to people like Emi, though, I couldn't care less about records or self-improvement."

    "Running for the sake of running is a perfectly good way to spend the time, after all. Not that Hisao seems to really see it that way."

    "He might have cheated by joining me well after I'd started, but his heart having played up during the holidays has made me appreciate how he still throws himself at the track. He still doggedly tries to regain his previous physical fitness, or at least as much of it as he can."

    mk "You're keeping up well, Hisao."

    "I start slowing down as we get deeper in, eventually letting go of his hand as the two of us start to walk the rest of the distance. There isn't really any singular spot I'm looking for, so we end up almost strolling in the undergrowth for while."

    "Still breathing a little heavier than usual thanks to my efforts on the track, I make do with watching Hisao. The way his eyes turn this way and that makes it obvious he's a tourist more than a local."

    mk "Never been here before?"

    hi "Nope. I'd occasionally wondered what it was like behind the track."

    mk "Well now you know. I'm not totally sure if this land is actually owned by the school, but they sure don't make much effort to clean it up if they do."

    hi "Still not a scratch in the forests back up north, though."

    "I run my hand through my hair as I look about, seeing little but trees, bushes, and undergrowth. Listening intently reveals that we're not quite alone, with fallen leaves shuffling in the distance from some squirrel darting about. As far as human go, though, there are few who'd venture this far on a whim."

    "My companion slowly stops walking as we reach the heart of the forest. Turning to see him, Hisao backs up to a tree and lets himself slide to the ground, letting his head fall back onto the trunk in defeat."

    mk "Oh no, I've been caught. Whatever will I do?"

    mk "There's nobody here, man. Besides, the fresh air will be a nice change to a stuffy bedroom."

    "Having had enough of talking, I wander over to him and turn about, sitting in his lap with my back to his chest."

    "As expected, the temptation soon becomes too great for him to resist. I let myself settle back into him as his hands come around my waist, his face coming beside mine."

    "The feeling of his large hands cuping my breasts makes me roll my head to the side, every muscle relaxing as he begins to knead and move them. There's a charming mix of curiosity and desire in his movements, which only makes this all the better."

    mk "Nice, aren't they?"

    hi "Wouldn't they be a pain while exercising?"

    mk "Worth it. Totally."

    "His hands snake underneath my gym top, the feeling of his skin against mine sending a shiver up my spine as he takes in the feeling of my taut stomach. I'm starting to think he likes it, with the way his hands linger over area."

    "Slowly, teasingly, he moves his hands upward. I can't help but sigh as he begins to grop me directly, my bra doing little to lessen the sensation of his playing with my breasts."

    "This is the best. Just sitting here being played with, drifting on the current of pleasure without a care in the world. I don't think he's really trying to get me off so much as explore how my body feels, but I enjoy that fact."

    "With my hand and stump lying on my thighs, it's easy for my hand to absentmindedly slide down just an inch of two, the side of it settling between my legs. All it takes is the smallest movement to feel it rubbing through my spats, settling into a nice, regular rhythm."

    "It isn't until Hisao notices me getting a little too dreamy that he notices I'm masturbating in his lap."

    hi "Miki..."

    mk "Just keep going."

    "He obediently does so, and as I feel something against my butt, I can tell it's turning Hisao on like crazy. I can't help myself, and if it turns him on, all the better."

    "Wanting to do this himself, he shifts his left hand to continue kneading my right breast, his other hand moving downward."

    "Hisao manages to slide his fingers between my sweaty skin and the top of my spats, pausing a little as he feels how aroused I've become. Gathering the courage to try fingering me for the first time, he brings his middle finger over my lower hair and begins to stroke at the most important spot."

    "It's when he starts a slow circling motion that he really manages to nail it, making me practically melt."

    mk "Aaah... that's good..."

    mk "See? It was worth watching each other."

    "In a surprisingly quick movement, two of his fingers flick downward and slide into me, making a come hither motion with enough force to make me cringe from pain."

    mk "Ah! Ow! Too much!"

    hi "Then don't tease someone with their fingers between your legs."

    mk "Asshole..."

    hi "What did I say?"

    "Having had quite enough of his lip, I twist around and grab the knot of his tie. Hisao's surprise is met with a strong tug as I let myself fall to the ground, his body falling on top of me."

    hi "Hey, Miki-!"

    "He tries to pin me down out of frustration, but I manage to overpower him. With a bit of a scuffle, I free my arm and give a solid shove to his shoulder, using my stomach muscles to send him toppling over onto his back. I quickly follow, ending up on all fours above him. He gives a weak smile as I grin in victory."

    mk "I win."

    "I move my head down to kiss him, out tongues meeting as the experience begins to sweep us away. My heart beating away and body more than ready to ravage him, I slip off his tie and work away at his buttons."

    "I can feel myself panting as I move further and further down, finally undoing the last button. Hisao sits up and quickly shirks it as I continue to undress him, each piece of clothing ending up discarded without much thought. Eventually I manage to work off his underwear, the boy naked in the midsummer's day."

    "I move forwards to kiss him once more, but as our mouths meet, I'm take off guard by his hands coming to my shoulders and throwing me down onto the ground. I've done it to him before, but now that the shoe's on the other foot, I'm left more dazed than anything."

    "His mouth is pushed onto mine, my breath stolen as his tongue darts in and moves about, tangling with my own and refusing to let go. I kick, jerk, and squirm under his grasp, but he keeps going, our saliva mixing as he takes his fill of me."

    "Eventually, finally, he breaks off. My heart's almost hurting from how fast its beating, my attempts to speak amounting to little as my need for air takes precedence."

    mk "Hisao..."

    hi "There. I win."

    "I can't help but laugh, my body convulsing with hilarity at the ridiculous sight. It makes me glad to see him bring forceful like this, taking what he wants. It sure is a change from the subdued and hesitant kid who so akwardly introduced himself to class all that time ago."

    "I reach up and take the side of his cheek in my hand, quite take with the fellow holding himself above me. My breathing finally under control, I smile and say four simple words."

    mk "Then take me, Hisao."

    "He needs no further urging, grabbing me and rolling my body about with a fair amount of force. Having ended up with my chest on the ground, I try to pick myself up, only to feel a hand grabbing the back of my spats."

    "With a strong tug, Hisao exposes my butt and crotch to the air."

    mk "Oh...!"

    "He jams himself into me with enough strength to cause a damn lot of pain, our hips hitting with a loud sound. The pain and surprising force that he's become comfortable in using against me combine to send my front falling back to the ground, the side of my face hitting the dirt as as he pulls back and begins to thrust."

    "He grips my butt tightly as he hits himself against it, each thrust slow but powerful. I can't help but yelp and moan loudly, all of my senses overwhelemed by the strange mixture of pain and pleasure. He goes harder and harder if anything, his confidence and lust building within him."

    "With little to grip onto, my hand grabs into the dirt and dead leaves, sweat pouring off me. More, I want him to move more. I like this Hisao, I love this Hisao..."

    "His desire not sated by his current motions, he picks up a knee and uses one his his hands to push down hard between my shoulderblades. I try to squirm out reflexively, but he simply pushes harder while shoving his rod ever deeper into me."

    mk "Hisao... ahn...!"

    "He doesn't say a word as he grunts away, teeth sounding like they're clenched as he drives onward. I can't move from his grasp, left with the side of my face pressed against the ground as rapturous pleasure floods my body."

    "Keep going, Hisao! I want more of you, I want more...!"

    "A huttural growl rises in my throat as a familiar sensation begins to rise, my heart racing as every sense starts to converge into a raging torrent of euphoria. Try as I might, I can't hold back the surge quickly rising with me."

    "It's a bizarre but deeply satisfying mixture of bliss, pain, and exhaustion that I've never felt before, the adrenaline filling my body in response to being held down mixing with the arousal threatening to so quickly send me over the edge."

    "I can't stop myself at all, Hisao's hold over me total and unshakable. I feel my neck muscles tightening as I growl and dig my fingers into the dirt to frantically try and keep control of my body, but I can't... I can't stop... I can't...!"

    mk "Aaaahn!"

    "My mind blanks as every muscle tightens, fingers and toes curling as the pleasure of orgasm wracks my body. Every sense is washed away in an instant as pure wonderous joy floods every corner of my consciousness."

    "I don't know how long it lasts, nor do I care. I'm in bliss. I lose track of everything, even my own self, as I utterly surrender to the feeling washing over me."

    "As I take one step over that peak, the real world begins to rush in to the vacuum within my addled mind. My collapse is all but instantaneous, every last ounce of energy I'd had being utterly exhausted as my hormones, and emotions, crash."

    "I simply flop onto the ground face-first, my limbs having gone entirely limp. Every sense feels muddled and unclear, from the blurry and unfocused ground before me, to my sense of touch barely registering the sweat soaking my body and clothes, and the feeling of Hisao's thick member slipping out."

    "Something warm touching my butt and lower back vaguely registers in my mind, but I don't care. I can't think right now. I just want to lie here, holding on to this feeling."

    "Hisao enters my vision as he sits and then falls back onto the ground, his bare chest heaving from the effort. I try to reach out and brush a couple of hairs sticking to his cheek, but my hand barely gets halfway before flopping the the ground for lack of energy."

    "There we lie, with the boy on his back and I on my front, breathing heavily as we try to recuperate. I manage to weakly smile at him, his hand reaching out and gently brushing some hairs from my forehead."

    mk "You really went all out, didn't you?"

    hi "I was frustrated with you, I guess."

    mk "Still frustrated?"

    hi "I lost track of what I was even annoyed about."

    "As we lie there looking at each other, that sensation I felt on my behind slowly comes back to haunt me."

    mk "You didn't...?"

    "He just averts his eyes. So he did finish himself off onto my back. I just let out a long breath, completely unable to muster anything more notable."

    hi "I wasn't thinking."

    mk "Just get a tissue."

    hi "...I really wasn't thinking."

    "About seven boys, likely first years by the looks of them, seem to have gotten their hands on a baseball bat and gloves from the storage shed. With their blazers piled near a tree, they've take to the field with gusto. Not a bad way to kill some time after school's finished for the day, really."

    "The batter lowers himself and brings his bat into position, preparing for the pitch. The posture of his upper body is pretty much right, but his footwork is horrible."

    "The pitcher's tongue flicks along his lips as he focuses himself. A quick look around the field betrays his lack of confidence, needing to reassure himself of where his few friends are standing. Going by the hand he's repeatedly dropping the ball into, looks like he's a southpaw."

    "I'd put money on the pitcher being the weak link in the game, despite the short-staffed fielding team. They manage to have left field, right field, and the shortstop position covered between them, waiting with ready hands and focused eyes."

    "The catcher nods, and with a long breath, the pitcher pulls his arm back. Everyone, including me, tenses up, waiting for the critical moment."

    "With little warning, that moment arrives. His left arm flies towards in an unmistakable fastball, his entire body moving with the one goal of getting as much speed on the thing as possible. While he's no professional, the sight of a fit body in such fluid, practiced motion is one of the most impressive things to watch."

    "For an amateur just messing around, he sure put some steam on it. The batter's eyes remain steadfastly on the ball, not shrinking from the challenge."

    "The sound of impact echoes around the field as he nails a solid hit, the ball shooting flat and just to the right."

    "...And straight into the stomach of one very unfortunate fielder. Everyone around cringes at the sight."

    "The force of the blow dazes him for a moment before he crumples to the ground, arms clutching at his sore torso. It doesn't take long for his friends to quickly jog over."
